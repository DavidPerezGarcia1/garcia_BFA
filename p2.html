<p class="tworow">Artist Statement  </p>
<p class="eightrow">Well growing up as a kid, I was not actually a huge art kid throughout those experiences,<br>
   I was normally playing around with my family, playing video games. However, during my 12 <br>
   years of age and up to now, I realize making art is not only fun but I was actually able to express<br>
    myself so much more than me talking to someone somehow. This new change of my idea, I slowly <br>
    build up experience and ideas of my own art or other worlds, my own idea of what art should be.<br>
    Which is being able to express oneself to the fullest that no simple conversation can out do it. <br>
    Starting off with simple drawings of what I like in general,like a video game disc that I played from <br>
    my brother or my favorite toy when I was much younger. Unfortunately during that time I wasn't able<br>
     to get my own lap or any device to make digital art in general. However, during my teenage years and<br>
      now, I have built up my own digital art from a wide variety of different mediums, from photoshop to 3D <br>
      models. When talking about digital media art, as soon as I touched the concept of it and the idea of how<br>
      to make/display it into digital art, I was hooked on it right away. I instantly wanted to learn more, and <br>
      even more than that, to a point it's a lot of struggle and tedious work to handle overall. The more I learn<br>
      new methods and subjects like learning 3D  modeling for example, it pushes me back from stage one to <br>
      learn all together. However, this doesn't stop me, I push myself to learn but also express those models of<br>
      what i want it to be, from a model of myself or a character from a show. I learn so much about narration, <br>
    creativity in digital media, especially video art and 3D modeling, which I am most passionate about. Digital<br>
     media made me think heavily about why, what is the purpose of this art work i am making, for example, I <br>
     can me cool looking model or lots of brush function in p5.js, however, in my opinion, it doesn't mean<br>
      anything if there is no purpose behind it form first place, must have story in way to see and act. In my <br>
      opinion, the fact that I am able to achieve the exact outcome I wanted from any digital medium, is the best <br>
      part of making out with, learning how to work around issues that I am unable to fix, and really push myself<br>
       as an artist of being forced into issues that I normally dont face. This is why i want to pursue more into <br>
       digital medium as a whole, by pushing myself, even though I admit have weak point in parts of my art like <br>
       coding for example, but its those realization of knowing my flaws that only improve myself more as digital<br>
        artist or otherwise how can i stand my own meaning as artist.
